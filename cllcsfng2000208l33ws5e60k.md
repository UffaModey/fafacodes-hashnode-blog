# Introduction üì∂

AI Feedback API is a GraphQL API project that is masterfully built and deployed on [Grafbase](https://grafbase.com/docs). This project harnesses [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/overview) to provide feedback for blog post content sourced from [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), serving as the project's Content Management System (CMS).

The AI Feedback API enhances the traditional approach to content assessment by automating the intricate process of scrutinizing blog posts and providing intelligent, structured, and clear feedback devoid of direct human bias.

The project provides direct support for editors, reviewers and other assessors of written comms by optimizing the time taken for them to grasp the essence of the blog post's content.

## Video Demo üìπ

## Inspiration & Development Method üôè

Currently, many of the software tools for leveraging AI in the writing sector are more focused on using AI as a copywriter to generate content or as a bot to check for grammatical errors within a blog post. This was the foundation for inspiration in creating the project. AI Feedback API amalgamates text-generation AI features with AI text analysis features to give a review of text-based content that has been created by an author.

![Happy You Can Do It GIF by Lillee Jean](https://media3.giphy.com/media/4H6Gt3lWzoRWLubyPG/200w.gif?cid=ecf05e47ptb0zr8deggfz90i078ruymdip0v8xfc3p3yl98p&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=200w.gif&ct=g align="center")

The project uses Contentful as the primary data source for the GraphQL API. The details for each of the blog posts that we want to get feedback on are stored on Contentful. This includes the author, title and body of the blog post. The GraphQL API is deployed on Grafbase. It uses a GraphQL resolver to extend its functionality and include a field for feedback in the response to a `POST` request to the API. The resolver is customized to include a function where blog posts from Contentful pass through the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model for generating natural language to provide detailed feedback for the body of each blog post.

The project backend was configured using the Typescript SDK.

# Prerequisites üëÇ

* [GitHub](https://github.com/login) account for signing up on Grafbase and for hosting the project repo remotely.
    
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing the remote API.
    

# Contentful for Data Sourcing üëú

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/platform/) is a Content Management System (CMS) that uses an API-first architecture to enable the orchestration of digital content. By using Contentful in this project, we are able to have a platform where blog posts can be conveniently uploaded on. This will act as the primary data source in the project. We will create a model for the blog post on Contentful that we will use to further create a number of blog posts which will receive feedback using a query to the Grafbase AI Feedback API.

To get started with Contentful, [log in or signup to](https://be.contentful.com/login) Contentful using your personal credentials.

## Creating data using the Content Model

* Open a new project space.
    
* From the **Content model menu** within the project space, **add a new content type**. Contentful uses a structure called "*Content Type*" to define a piece of content. Each Content Type consists of various fields, which represent different properties of that content.
    
* ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690896077635/71435552-881e-4643-85a6-756c9b6f07a7.png align="center")
    
    Create a model for `Blog` in Contentful.
    
* ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690896281364/cc3deca7-93b4-40e5-b104-556d0b1d2ea3.png align="center")
    
* Add fields for:
    
    * `Title` - short text field
        
    * `Author` - short text field
        
    * `Post` - long text field
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690897870226/0765c5bf-c352-4605-9642-4cc2f3a55b65.png align="center")
        
* Save the model
    
* Create content for the newly set up model. This will be the first Blog entry. Click on **Content** and click on **Add entry**. Ensure that the **Content type** is set to `Blog`

## Connecting to Contentful API using API Keys

Next, we have to obtain the *Contentful API URL* and the *API Key*.

* From the Contentful space homepage, go to **Settings** and click on **API Keys**.
    
* Add a **New API Key** for this project. Give it a name.
    
* Click **save**.
    
* Show the **Space ID** and the **Content Delivery API** access token. Copy these and save them in a secure place for future reference.

# Using Grafbase for the Backend üîó

Grafbase allows users to create and deploy their own GraphQL API securely. It offers features like integrating various data sources using resolvers and connectors, setting up edge caching, implementing authentication and permission rules, and enabling serverless search.

Grafbase provides a CLI tool for local development, and each Git branch has a dedicated preview deployment for testing and collaboration purposes.

Visit the [Grafbase](https://grafbase.com/) home page to create an account. I signed up using my GitHub account.

## Creating Grafbase Edge Gateway

The project backend is developed using a Grafbase Edge Gateway which will run locally and can be deployed later to the edge.

* Run the command below from the project directory on your CLI to install the [@grafbase/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grafbase/sdk) and then create a new project in the directory with the next command. Agree to install the `grafbase@0.29.0` package if you are prompted to do so.
    
    `npm install @grafbase/sdk --save-dev`
    
    `npx grafbase init blog-feedback --template graphql-contentful`
    
* ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690981431317/746c28a6-2055-401f-bbf8-34ca9c9c5bba.png align="center")
    
    From your programming IDE of choice (I am using PyCharm), open up the project folder and view the `grafbase/grafbase.config.ts` file.
    
* The `grafbase/grafbase.config.ts` file is used to configure the backend for this project. It generates information for deployment to the GraphQL Edge Gateway. Here we will configure the edge resolvers used for the inputting control, flexibility and logic to the API.
    
* ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690981557133/cfb52315-878c-43d7-b2d9-73b64effc246.png align="center")
    
    Open the `.env` file and update the field below with the details saved from creating the Contentful API Keys.
    
    `CONTENTFUL_API_URL=`[`https://graphql.contentful.com/content/v1/spaces/SPACE_ID`](https://graphql.contentful.com/content/v1/spaces/SPACE_ID) `CONTENTFUL_API_TOKEN=`
    

## Connecting Grafbase to Contentful Data

* Run the command below to use the Grafbase CLI to run your GraphQL API locally. Ensure that you are running Node.js version `v18.0.0` or higher on your PC.
    

```plaintext
npx grafbase dev
```

* ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690983918011/53948d96-4e06-4f74-b5ba-c27c2f7afb8c.png align="center")
    
* Click on [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/) to open up your web browser and execute a query for fetching the blog data from Contentful.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690984837590/02197bf3-f90e-43f6-a144-823e26e6adef.png align="center")

* From the **View Pathfinder** page, we can see three columns **Query, Document** and **Response**.
    
* The **Query** section is a collapsable menu where we can select the content from the Contentful account which we want to include in the query.
    
* The selected query is highlighted in bold and is automatically updated in the **Document** column.
    
* ```graphql
        query Contentful {
          contentful {
            blogCollection {
              items {
                title
                author
                post
              }
            }
          }
        }
    ```
    
* The **Document** column enables the use of code as the command for the query. The command in the screenshot is to fetch the data from the Blog content model from Contentful. This has been named as `blogCollection`. The fields that are to be included in the query are specified using the `items` curly brackets.
    
* Click on the *Run Contentful* button on the **Document** header to run the query and view the response in the **Response** column.
    
* ```json
        {
          "data": {
            "contentful": {
              "blogCollection": {
                "items": [

# Integrating OpenAI API to Grafbase using Resolvers üíé

This project leverages [GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) (gpt-3.5-turbo) by [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/overview) which is a powerful set of models to generate natural language. It has been optimized for chat and use cases that are suitable for text completion tasks. This AI model is used to provide feedback for the blog posts that are contained within the project.

Create an OpenAI account [here](https://auth0.openai.com/u/signup/identifier?state=hKFo2SB2NDJOejNmV3NWdXI0VlRtY21TU2FJUzliN1ZxNHB4YqFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIG40NkJja09Vb1hUbU11ei1DY0plNWxwVmRmTVktWFNPo2NpZNkgRFJpdnNubTJNdTQyVDNLT3BxZHR3QjNOWXZpSFl6d0Q). I created one using my Google account for SSO login.

[Grafbase](https://grafbase.com/docs) uses a *resolver* to extend the Grafbase backend and include the functionality of obtaining data from other data sources. For this project, we will extend the Contentful blog Grafbase API app to include feedback for each blog post through the gpt-3.5-turbo language model by OpenAI.

![Happy Artificial Intelligence GIF by Digital Pratik](https://media0.giphy.com/media/QL8RF2CdcuK1YzkWqm/200w.gif?cid=ecf05e47rfnc4vrhsemmv1j6jiivmqkf67rn4l2goc60muel&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=200w.gif&ct=g align="center")

Resolvers are used to integrate custom business logic into the Grafbase backend.

## Creating a Field Resolver for Getting the Post from the root

The field resolver `feedback` will return feedback on the blog post from the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model.

* Update `grafbase/grafbase.config.ts` to extend the Contentful type with a new `feedback: JSON` field.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691370714299/3de34324-7313-4ea8-9712-abb2142bb81e.png align="center")
    
* Create a new file `grafbase/resolvers/contentful/blog/feedback.ts` and update it with the snippet below.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690989002212/f0c4c8c8-014d-48f4-86ef-f1b0101478e7.png align="center")
    
* Update the `feedback.ts` file to get the post for the `Blog` entry in order to make a request for fetching the feedback.
    
* Set the first arg name as `root` in the resolver to allow the value for the post to be restructured from the root.
    

```typescript
export default function Resolver(root) {
  const { post } = root
}
```

## Create OpenAI API Key for Fetching the Feedback for a Post

* Log into your OpenAI account and navigate to the [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) page.
    
* Click **Create new secret key** and give it a name.
    
* ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691060017544/a8180ae4-47ef-4a99-a463-e696aade9cd3.png align="center")
    
    Copy the new secret key displayed and save it in a secure location as you will be unable to view this again.
    
* Add the newly created OpenAI API key to the `grafbase/.env` file.
    

```typescript
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

* Update the resolver to assess the environment variable using `process.env`
    

```typescript
export default function Resolver(root) {
  const { post } = root
  const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
}
```

* The next step is to apply the `post` values from Contentful as the prompt to an API request to OpenAI.
    

## Using OpenAI GPT-3.5 Model to Generate Feedback

[GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create) is an OpenAI model that is able to understand and generate natural language. This project uses the text-davinci-003 model. Update the feedback.ts file with the code below to include AI-generated feedback for every blog post that is returned by that Grafbase API request to Contentful.

```typescript
export default async function Resolver(root){
  let instruction: string = "Give feedback on this blog post: ";
  const { post } = root
  
  if (!post) return null

  return fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'text-davinci-003',
      prompt: instruction + post,
      max_tokens: 200,
      temperature: 0.7
    })
  })
    .then(res => res.json())
}
```

* The headers of the request contain the `Authorization` and the `Content-Type` fields.
    
* The request body contains the model, prompt, max\_tokens and temperature fields.
    
    * `model`: Specifies the language model to be used for generating the text; in this case, "text-davinci-003" refers to OpenAI's "Davinci" GPT-3.5 model variant.
        
    * `prompt`: Provides the initial input or context for the model to start generating text. It sets the initial context for the text generation.
        
    * `max_tokens`: Defines the maximum number of tokens (words or subwords) that the model should generate in its response. It limits the length of the generated text.
        
    * `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the model's output; a higher value like 1.0 makes the output more diverse and creative, while a lower value like 0.2 makes it more focused and deterministic.

The response to the Grafbase API, when it is run from [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/), is shown in the screenshot above. The response now includes a field called `feedback` which contains a `text` subfield where the AI-generated feedback for the blog post is showcased.

```json
"feedback": {
    "choices": [{
        "finish_reason": "stop",
        "index": 0,
        "logprobs": null,
        "text": "\n\nThis is a great blog post about the advantages of Python! 
                It covers the history of the language, its wide range of applications, and its user-friendly nature. 
                It also gives an overview of the language's library ecosystem and cross-platform compatibility. 
                The post does a great job of highlighting the benefits of using Python for developers of all levels."}],

# Troubleshooting and Errors ‚ùå

* **Git**: During the step where we put our local branch to the remote branch on GitHub, if the git error below arises, use the subsequent command to override the error.
    
* ```plaintext
      * branch main -> FETCH_HEAD 
      fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
    ```
    
    `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories`
    
* **Grafbase Deployment**: The deployment to the Grafbase Edge from GitHub may fail for a number of reasons. The error message from failed deployment will be displayed on the build logs which is visible from the Grafbase account page.

# Next Steps and Further Development üíØ

* Update the OpenAI model version used in the development. The version currently used in the project is no longer actively supported, and itis advisable to migrate to a newer version before (January 4, 2024) to avoid any disruptions in the service.
    
    ![Coming Soon GIF](https://media0.giphy.com/media/KzeZ3OXHoSDVZH9cmy/200w.gif?cid=ecf05e47mpsjhd0oqckv7a5iqhcrj2cmo66k1n7qrnl4yt5c&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=200w.gif&ct=g align="center")
    
* Enhance the capabilities of the Grafbase API to accommodate more logic in each API request such as specifying aspects of the work closer feedback and recommendations should be given of enabling the user to get feedback that is tailored to content from a specific sector.
