2024! Wow! What a year! I am honestly amazed at how it turned out. This year has been a journey of immense growth, learning, and self-discovery. As I step into 2025, I find myself reflecting on the progress I made in various aspects of my life.

The year began with an incredible surge of energy and enthusiasm. I was inspired, motivated, and determined to set ambitious goals and craft detailed plans to achieve them. To be honest, I can’t pinpoint the exact source of this drive, but I’m grateful I had it. With my characteristic zeal, I embarked on the year armed with a big plan—because, why not? My motto for 2024 was "Be fearless (Be cringe)," a reminder to embrace boldness and not shy away from the unconventional.

Of course, reality had its own twists and turns. No, I didn’t stick to the plan. No, I don’t even know when or where I veered off course. And no, I can’t say exactly where I’ve landed in the grand scheme of things. But what I can say, with absolute certainty, is that 2024 was a truly fulfilling year. I’m proud of how I faced challenges head-on and how I pushed myself to confront difficulties with courage. While the specifics of my “grand plan” may have shifted, I achieved what I now realize was my ultimate goal: to learn the essence of fearlessness.

As part of my annual review, I asked myself to summarize 2024 in six words. These words represent the lessons and experiences that defined my year.

# Fearless

Of course, "fearless" is the first word that came to my mind. Fearlessness was the overarching theme of 2024. My goal was to cultivate confidence and strength in myself, my skills, and my abilities to pursue my life goals unapologetically.

I kicked off the year by hosting a GitHub Portfolio Challenge for alumni of Durham University Computer Science Department’s TechUp Women Program. This two-day virtual event aimed to introduce the TechUp Women community to GitHub as a tool for collaboration, version control, code hosting, documentation, and open-source contributions. During the challenge, I demonstrated how to create a GitHub account, deploy a technical project to a GitHub repository, review and contribute to open-source projects, and utilize GitHub across various IT roles—from data science and software development to QA testing, DevOps, system administration, cybersecurity, technical writing, and IT support.

I needed to embody fearlessness in my career as a software engineer this year. Setting skill-based goals with my manager and working diligently to achieve them resulted in a strong performance review. This experience reinforced my belief in my capabilities and helped me grow professionally.

As the winner of the [2023 Rising Star in Tech Award for North East England by Dynamo](https://dynamitesawards.co.uk/dynamites-2023/), I was honoured to be invited as a judge for the [2024 Dynamo Awards in the Rising Star category](https://dynamitesawards.co.uk/award-categories/rising-star/). This role exposed me to a plethora of talented individuals in the regional tech sector, and I felt privileged to contribute by reviewing nominations in this inspiring category.

# Determination

This year, I learned to be resolute in pursuing the things I wanted. It required tapping into an inner strength that kept me showing up, even on days when I felt exhausted or wished for 25 hours in a day.

I was determined to dive fully into the world of AI as a practising expert, and I made significant strides toward this goal. From intentionally networking within the global AI community to starting the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders course by Fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/), I explored various methods to deepen my understanding of key AI topics, including computer vision, image classification, natural language processing, and neural networks. Additionally, I completed [Microsoft’s AI Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification) course, where I built several demo MVP projects using Azure AI cloud services. Through project-based learning, I also created step-by-step technical documentation resources that can support teaching and learning in the AI sector.

At [Digital Grassroots](https://digitalgrassroots.org/), determination fueled our efforts to build and strengthen our global team. We focused on enhancing the organization’s sustainability and growth by recruiting talented youth from the Sub-Saharan African region for key roles, including Business Operations Manager and Communications and Community Lead. These additions brought fresh perspectives to our work and boosted our productivity during challenging times.

Another milestone was the launch of the second version of our DIGRA Monopoly game project. Originally funded by [C/Change](https://cchange.xyz/lab-2022/2023-project-presentations/) in 2023, this project engages players to reflect on the digital ecosystem through the lived experiences and expertise of Digital Grassroots’ global youth community.

# Community

I actively sought out tech communities to expand my network and connect with like-minded individuals.

One highlight was securing community-based funding to attend the [2024 EuroPython Conference](https://ep2024.europython.eu/) in Prague, Czech Republic. This opportunity allowed me to engage with tech enthusiasts at various levels of expertise, learn from Python experts about trending topics, and explore ways to contribute to open-source Python projects.

I also became a member of the [Black Python Developers Network](https://blackpythondevs.com/), a vibrant community of Pythonistas who share my background and interests.

Additionally, I received a Diversity Scholarship to attend 2024 [PyData London](https://pydata.org/london2024/), where I participated in workshops, tutorials, exhibitions, social events, sprints, side events, and lightning talks. This event was another valuable experience to learn and grow within the Python and data science community.

Representing Digital Grassroots, I was honoured to give the keynote speech at the [2024 Nigeria Youth Internet Governance Forum](https://youthigf.org.ng/nyigf-2024/). Delivering this speech remotely was particularly meaningful, as I witnessed the growth of the NYIGF community since I first convened the event in 2019.

I also attended two [Women in Tech North East UK](https://www.linkedin.com/company/women-in-tech-north-east/posts/?feedView=all) events. These meetups offered both formal and social opportunities to connect with peers, colleagues, and friends while discussing challenges and opportunities for women in tech in the region.

Another highlight was being invited as an individual member of the [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/individual-members/). This recognition of my contributions to the Django community was a proud moment for me.

Finally, I was approved for another year in the [AWS Community Builders Program](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/). Through this initiative, I created and shared educational and technical content to actively engage with and contribute to the AWS community.

# Self-Discovery

Prioritizing the quality of my life was a major focus for me this year. I became intentional about the persona I wanted to present to the world and the care I devoted to my well-being. Even small joys, like maintaining a skincare routine and indulging in manicures and pedicures, became essential priorities.

Travelling holds a special place in my heart, and this year I visited nine countries: the Netherlands, Italy, Turkey, Albania, Canada, the Dominican Republic, Czech Republic, Croatia and Scotland. While this was nice, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I hadn’t travelled enough. Unfortunately, I ran out of leave days at work before the year ended—a frustrating reality for a globetrotter like me. Missing out on spontaneous travel opportunities, even with great flight and hotel deals, was a hard pill to swallow.

While I wasn’t as consistent with exercise as I’d hoped, I made a point to get back on track whenever I fell off. That’s what matters most—the ability to restart and stay committed.

# Care

I learned to be more in touch with my emotions and to care deeply for my loved ones. It’s not that I didn’t love them before, but this year I focused on expressing that love more openly and meaningfully.

Starting with myself, I learned to listen to my body more and give it exactly what it needed at each moment—true self-care.

I reached new heights in both new and old friendships. I am profoundly grateful for the friends in my life this year. I am especially thankful for those who allowed me to open my heart to them and who embraced me, even during times when I felt I had little to offer. I love you all so much!

I explored my relationships with people more cautiously and strategically. This thoughtful approach has saved me from unnecessary complications and wasted energy in my life.

One of the most significant moments of the year was reconnecting with some of my family members after as long as four years apart. These reunions were incredibly meaningful. I love my family deeply and cherish the memories we created this year. For those I haven’t seen yet, I miss you dearly and can’t wait to reunite.

# Curiosity

This year, I became curious about many things beyond the world of tech, sparking a newfound passion for reading and researching in diverse areas.

One area I explored was financial investments. I was eager to start making smarter financial moves, which led me to dive into stocks and shares.

I also dedicated significant time to self-study and research on running profitable businesses. My goal is to eventually build my own business in the near future, and this journey of curiosity has laid the groundwork for that dream.

# Lessons Learned and Looking Ahead

Honestly, I don’t want to say too much in this section, but here are a few things on my radar as I move forward:

* Plan better: Create a plan, stick to it, and remain open to adapting as needed.
    
* Document more: Share openly and maintain private records to track progress and reflections.
    
* Build more: Continue creating and innovating.
    
* Collaborate more: Seek meaningful partnerships and teamwork opportunities.
    

Overall, 2024 was incredible! Cheers to an even better 2025!
